 The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an
 age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING,
 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a
 smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
 accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and
 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been
 video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been
 randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected
 for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

 The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by
 applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56
 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal,
 which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a
 Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The
 gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components,
 therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a
 vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and
 frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

 For each record it is provided:

 * Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the
   estimated body acceleration.
 * Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
 * A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
 * Its activity label.
 * An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

# Approach including code

## Load packages
library(tidyverse)

## Download and unzip data
```
location <- "H:/Kurse/DataScience/DCleaning/Week4/data/UCI HAR Dataset"
setwd(location)
if(!file.exists("./data")){dir.create("./data")}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
download.file(fileUrl,destfile="./data/Dataset.zip")
unzip(zipfile="./data/Dataset.zip",exdir="./data")
```


Read subject files
```
subTrain <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(location, "train", "subject_train.txt")))
subTest  <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(location, "test" , "subject_test.txt" )))
```
Read activity files
```
activityTrain <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(location, "train", "Y_train.txt")))
activityTest  <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(location, "test" , "Y_test.txt" )))
```
Read data files
```
dataTrain <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(location, "train", "X_train.txt" )))
dataTest  <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(location, "test" , "X_test.txt" )))
```
### 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Merge training and test data for subjects and activity and rename
```
subdataAll <- rbind(subTrain, subTest)
subdataAll <- rename(subdataAll, subject = V1)
acdataAll <- rbind(activityTrain, activityTest)
acdataAll <- rename(acdataAll, activityType = V1)
```
Merge training and test data and rename variables based on feature
```
dataMerge <- rbind(dataTrain, dataTest)
Features <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(location, "features.txt")))
Features <- rename(Features, Number = V1, trackedVariable = V2)
colnames(dataMerge) <- Features$trackedVariable
```
Merge to full data set 
```
subjectActivityAll <- cbind(subdataAll, acdataAll)
dataMerge <- cbind(subjectActivityAll, dataMerge)
```

### 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
```
dataMeasureMean <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", Features$trackedVariable, value=TRUE) 
dataMeasureMean <- union(c("subject","activityType"), dataMeasureMean)
dataMerge <- subset(dataMerge, select = dataMeasureMean)
```
### 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
```
labels <- read.table("activity_labels.txt", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
dataMerge$activityType <- labels[dataMerge$activityType, 2]
```
### 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names

Remove non-alphanumeric symbols.
Improve visiblity of mean and std by capital letters.
```
names(dataMerge) <- gsub("[^[:alnum:]]", "", names(dataMerge))
names(dataMerge) <- gsub ("std", "SD", names(dataMerge))
names(dataMerge) <- gsub ("mean", "Mean", names(dataMerge))
head(str(dataMerge),2)
```

### 5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Beginning from the third column calculate means for each subject and activity.
```
aggregatedData <- aggregate(dataMerge[, 3:ncol(dataMerge)],
                       by=list(subject = dataMerge$subject, 
                               activityType = dataMerge$activityType),
                       mean)
```
